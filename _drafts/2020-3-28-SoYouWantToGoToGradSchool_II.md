title: So you want to go to grad school.. (part 2)
---

Lets assume you have found some labs who do interesting research.. now what? This is a weird, not-really-secret, secret of graduate school applications: before you apply you need to email those professors. This has, partly, to do with the way admissions work in ecology and evolution. Again, I am about to describe the "general" case, which could have many exceptions but here goes.. each lab has some number of funded graduate positions. Stick with me. The advisor might have some allocated TA positions from the department or have their own grant that can support a student but where ever the money is coming from to fund a student, it is usually tied to the professor. So if a professor has this money but no student, they can recuit a student to their lab. This means that you want to have the professor (that you are applying to work with) fighting for you in the application process. This is true to different extents in different programs, there are definitely programs which are more democratic (and I am NOT saying this is how it should be, I am telling you how it works right now..). If you have one of those outside fellowships (like the NSF GRFP) this might give you a little more freedom in applications, because you come with your own money. But this is just one reason you want to get in contact with potential advisors before applying to grad school. The other, probably more important reason, is that you want to make sure its going to be a good fit. As I mentioned, this is going to be a person (or group of people) you are working closely with over the next 2-6 years, you want to make sure you are going to get along and have a productive working relationship.
