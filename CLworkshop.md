### Welcome to the ITP Skills Labs for the Command Line!

28 October 2019 \| Kathryn Mercier

The command line is a tool to control your computer using a text interface. It will be 
very useful if you are working with very large text data sets, or want to run the same
process over and over again. 

Skills we will cover in this workshop include: navigating & creating folders; 
listing, searching & moving batches of files; editing & running shell scripts.
