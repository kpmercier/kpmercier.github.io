title: Some things I didn't know before (applying to) grad school - in no particular order
---

I am writing this list down for two reasons. First - in case there are other people out there, who like me, didn't know these things. Maybe this list can provide someone with a bit of information they didn't have before. Or maybe they have already figured these things out through experience, and we can just feel a little less alone hehe. Second - I am writing this for future me. (Hi future Kathryn! Hope the future is a less bleak than it seems!). I want to be able to remember what it was like before I knew what I know now. Stick with me - most of us tend to forget what we didn't know. For example, it might be difficult to explain your science to non-scientists because they don't know what a niche is and you can't even comprehend not knowing what a niche is! I want to avoid getting out of touch, by remembering what I didn't know. 

That your advisor should be an author on your poster presentation when they’re funding your work (sorry Chris - fixed this one quickly!)

Being ‘first-generation’ was a category, and could be used to my benefit

You could get PAID to go to school

Talks were not the only beneficial thing to happen at conferences

That grad school wasn’t just another series of classes

Grants which fund research and grants which fund you (through stipends) both exist

Why many of my undergrad teachers kind of sucked at teaching. They weren’t being judged by their teaching, they were being judged on their research

How crucial communicating (written and oral) your science is

That you apply to work ‘with people’ not ‘at institutions’

Everything I’ve learned before is wrong, and no one knows anything for sure (a literal thing I tweeted my first year)

You can make a timeline... but then multiple how long each item should take by like ten... at least

That post-docs were a thing

Having a community inside AND outside of grad school is essential for your mental health

How much good presentation slides can improve audience comprehension (this could be a whole ‘nother post)
