Welcome to my new website! I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org/">Carnaval Lab</a> at City 
College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center. I am broadly interested in understanding 
the drivers of diversity using a combination of approaches. I am especially interested 
in using information about the historical effects of climate to make inferences about 
how current climate change will effect species.

I received my MS from the University of Central Florida in the 
<a href="parkinsonlab.com">Parkinson Lab</a>.  My thesis research used statistical 
phylogeography to test hypotheses about the historical dispersal of mole skinks 
<i>Plestiodon egregius</i>.
