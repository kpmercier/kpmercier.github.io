28 October 2019 \| Kathryn Mercier \| CUNY Graduate Center

This lab has been modified from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lesson [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

## __Objectives__

1. Understand why the command line is useful
2. Gain a basic toolkit to start using the command line
3. Be able to find resources to build your personal toolkit

## __1. Understand why the command line is useful__

We have many ways of interacting with computers. We can use a mouse and keyboard, touch screens, and even voice commands. When we interact with our personal computers, we are usually using a graphical user interface, or GUI. GUIs are a visual representation of a program and allow us to use the mouse and keyboard to click options and input arguments to run the program. 

While GUIs are intuitive and work well most of the time, imagine the following scenario. For a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take advantage of the command line, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. With the proper commands, the command line can repeat tasks as many times as we want.

Today, we will be using a Unix-based command line, used on Mac and Linux computers. Windows computers use a slightly different language for their command line, but the skills we learn should be transferable. Skills we will cover in this workshop include: navigating & creating folders; listing, searching & moving batches of files; editing & running shell scripts.
