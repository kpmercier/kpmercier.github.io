## __2. Gain a basic toolkit to start using the command line__

### _Fundamentals_

When you start up a terminal you will see a prompt

```shell
$ 
```

Lines beginning with # are comments and are not executed. The command line is used to run programs, which may have options and arguements

```shell
# This is the general format of unix command line tools
$ program -option1 -option2 argument
> output
```

You can find information about programs, including its options and arguments, using the help option

```shell
# Running a program with the -h option (short for 'help') will print information on that programs usage
$ ls -h
```
