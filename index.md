Welcome to my new website! I am a PhD student in the 
<a href="http://www.carnavallab.org/">Carnaval Lab</a> at City College of New York and 
CUNY Graduate Center. I am interested in understanding what drives species distributions 
and diversity. My current work focuses on using information about the historical effects 
of environmental change to make inferences about how species will respond to current 
climate change. I integrate genetic data, demographic simulations, and 
ecological modelling to approach these questions.

I received my MS from the University of Central Florida in the 
<a href="parkinsonlab.com">Parkinson Lab</a>.  My thesis research used statistical 
phylogeography to test hypotheses about the historical dispersal of mole skinks 
<i>Plestiodon egregius</i>.
