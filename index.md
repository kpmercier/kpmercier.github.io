Welcome! My name is Kathryn Mercier, and I am an ecologist interested in how organisms respond to 
environmental change and how we can use that information to preserve biodiversity. Head over 
to my <a href="Research">Research page</a> for more specifics on my work.

I am currently working as a Forester with the NYC Parks department as well as finishing my doctoral research in 
the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org/">Carnaval Lab</a> 
at City College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center. Before these current endeavors I earned my MS from the 
University of Central Florida in the <a href="www.parkinsonlab.com/">Parkinson Lab</a>.
