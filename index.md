Welcome to my website! I am a biologist, interested in how organisms respond to 
environmental change, and how we can use that information to preserve biodiversity. I am 
especially fascinated by the North American coastal plains, this region hosts some amazing 
diversity and has an intriguing biogeographic history. 

Currently, I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org/">Carnaval Lab</a> 
at City College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center and I received my MS from the 
University of Central Florida in the <a href="parkinsonlab.com">Parkinson Lab</a>. Head over
to my <a href="Research">Research page</a> for more specifics on my work.
