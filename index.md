Welcome! My name is Kathryn, and I am a biologist. I am interested in how organisms respond to 
environmental change, and how we can use that information to preserve biodiversity. I am 
especially fascinated by the North American coastal plain as 
this region hosts some amazing diversity and has an intriguing biogeographic history.

Check out the <a href="images/north_american_coastal_plain.pdf">Atlas for the End of the 
World</a> for more information on the North American Coastal Plain and other biodiversity 
hotspots!

Currently, I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org/">Carnaval Lab</a> 
at City College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center and I earned my MS from the 
University of Central Florida in the <a href="www.parkinsonlab.com/">Parkinson Lab</a>. Head over
to my <a href="Research">Research page</a> for more specifics on my work.
